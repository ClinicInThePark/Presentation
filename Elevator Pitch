Clinic in the Park is a non-profit, orange-county-based organization that aims to provide free health services to Orange County residents, particularly those who do not have access to healthcare. Every second Sunday of the month, organizations from across Orange County come together under one banner to hold a “Health and Wellness Clinic” in the Orange County Great Park. Here, visitors can attend different booths and receive a variety of health services free of charge. 

Up until now, visitor data from these events has been collected solely through the use of electronic counters and a paper-based system. The problems with such a system is that it is inflexible, can be tedious to manage, and leaves room for error and misinterpretation.

Our goal in this project is to revamp this current system to be more flexible, efficient, and informative, so that Clinic in the Park can make better use of its visitor data, and ultimately improve upon its strategy in reaching out to the underserved portion of the community.
